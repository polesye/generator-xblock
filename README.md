## Getting Started

### Pre-requirements

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone -g https://github.com/polesye/generator-xblock.git
cd generator-xblock
git checkout v1
npm link
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

yo xblock
```

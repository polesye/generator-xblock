# generator-xblock [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/polesye/generator-xblock.png?branch=v1)](https://travis-ci.org/polesye/generator-xblock)


## Getting Started

### Pre-requirements

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Installation

To install generator-xblock from npm, run:

```bash
git clone -g https://github.com/polesye/generator-xblock.git
cd generator-xblock
git checkout v1
npm link
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
mkdir ~/my_first_xblock
cd ~/my_first_xblock
yo xblock
```
